<p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.1em;">
    ginmappeR is a web application that provides functionalities for translating gene or protein
    identifiers across various biological sequence databases, including CARD, NCBI Protein, Nucleotide
    and Gene, UniProt, and KEGG. It allows for easy mapping of identifiers across these databases,
    ensuring access to the most accurate and up-to-date information.

    In addition to identifier mapping, ginmappeR also offers the retrieval of NCBI identical proteins or
    UniProt similar genes clusters. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers, bioinformaticians,
    and anyone interested in gene and protein data.

    This application is built upon the ginmappeR R language package, available at the <a
        href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/ginmappeR">Bioconductor repository</a>. The package
    provides the core functionalities for identifier translation, which this web application makes
    accessible through a user-friendly interface.
